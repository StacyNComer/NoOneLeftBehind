	To actually choose which character is enchanted, have them interact with a cauldron. If a character is already enchanted,
	the enchantment will be transfered over to the new character.

	Having a character interact with a cauldron while already enchanted removes the enchantment.

	=== Note ===

	Button in this doc refers to the pressure plates. A "Hold Button" deactivates its trigger if nothing is standing on it. The
	rest of the Buttons toggle their trigger.
	
	Switch refers to the buttons set on a stand, which Bruno cannot press. All of these toggle their trigger so far.

	Consoles (which don't appear yet) refer to the Switches that only Percy can activate.

	Also, if these discriptions are confusioning or you have any other questions, don't be afraid to message me. I'm almost
	certainly free and can stream the solution to you.

	=== Map 1 (The first two rooms are just Bruno) ===

 Room 1A -> Have Bruno step on the pressure. Climb the platforms that rise.

 Room 1B -> Spawn a crate by stepping on the White Button. Throw the crate onto the Green Pressure Plate. This opens
	up the door to the Orange Button on the right as long as the crate is on the plate. Step on the Orange Button 
	to open the way to the exit. Bruno will need to use the crate as a platform to reach the exit door.

 Room 1 Secret -> Have Bruno press the Orange Button in Room 1B. Then, use that room's crate to jump back up to the platform
	leading to Room 1A. A door should have opened in the room Bruno spawned in revealing a secret.

 Room 3 -> Percival (The Techie) is introduced in this room. Bruno cannot progress until Percy escapes the his area.
	To do this, Percy must first press a Purple Switch to give him access to the rest of his area. On the left is a platform with a
	pressure plate that spawns a crate. Percy can reach this platform by riding up a nearby ramp and falling down onto the
	platform. Percy can then use his levitation to grab the spawned crate from a distance.

	Once Percy has the crate, it can be used as a platform to let him reach the Orange Switch, which will open the room
	with the Red Button when pressed. Percy can place the crate on the Red Button using his levitation (hold the THROW
	button down while holding the crate). This Button frees Percy and lets him meet Bruno.

	All characters must be at the room's exit to proceed. To get Percy to the exit, he must stand on the moving platform in
	front of the Green Button. Bruno can step on the button to raise Percy to a Blue Switch that opens up the exit. Bruno
	can follow Percy to the exit by simply jumping up the platform.

 Room 3 Secret -> Have Percy grab the crate off the Red Button while Bruno stands on the lowered Red Door. The door
		should raise Bruno into a room with a secret orb.

 Room 4 -> A Red "Hold" Button in the center of the starting room holds open the doors to a left and right room. Have Bruno stand
	on the button while Percy goes into the left room to press a Switch that spawns a crate on a tall platform in the right room. 
	Have Percy stand on the Red Button while Bruno walks into the room on the right and stands on the moving platform
	closest to the crate. Move Percy to the green button to raise the platform, and swap back to Bruno to jump to it, grab the
	crate, and toss it off the platform.

	Use Bruno (who shouldn't take the crate with him!) to let Percy into the right room and ue the green button to lift Percy and 
	the crate up. Have Percy set the crate on the Blue "Hold" Button, cross the now raised platform, and use Percy's levitation
	to pull the crate to the other side. From the exit room, have Percy throw the crate back down to Bruno.

	Finally, have Bruno set the crate on the Red Button and climb to the exit room from the left room.

	=== Map 2 (The first room is just Muriel) ===

 Room 1 -> There's a red switch that opens the door upstairs in the room you start in. 
	   
	   In the proceeding area, there is a blue button along the right side of the wall, a green button on the left side, and an 
                 orange button directly ahead of you. Pressing all of them will open up the room's exit.

Room 2 -> The other two characters start trapped and must be freed by the Muriel. After crossing the gap into the main area,
	  press the white button to spawn a crate you'll need later (As a reminder, Muriel refuses to pick up crates). Then, fly
	  up to the left and press the blue switch, which will open up a room behind Percy with a purple console. You can free 
	  Percy by swapping to him and pressing the console. Note that Percy is the only character able to use consoles.

	  Once Percy is free, drop him down from the left area and use the crate to cross a gap to the red console. Pressing this
	  will free Bruno.
	
 	  Use either Bruno or Percy to place the crate on the orange button, which should hold the exit room open. Move Percy
	  on top of the green platform and have Muriel stand on the green button to raise Percy upward and allow him to move
	  to the exit. You can then have Bruno and Muriel join him and complete the room.

Room 2 Secret -> If you walk onto the Yellow platform and behind the super steep ramp next to it, there is a secret room.

Room 3A -> Directly ahead, you'll find an anti-magic field. While the other two characters can simply walk through the barrier,
	the barrier will stop Muriel from passing whether she is on the ground or flying.

	If you move Bruno or Percy ahead, you'll find a blue button in a pit, under the cyan bridge standing on this button will
	disable the anti-magic barrier and allow Muriel to pass. You can then fly her on the other side of the pit to press a cyan
	switch to both open the way ahead and extend the bridge across the pit.

	The next area has a colorless anti-magic barrier; there is no way to deactivate it. If you move past it with Bruno, however,
	you will find a green button he can climb up to and stand on to open a gate above the anti-magic barrier, which Muriel
	can fly over. You can then have her fly up to the yellow switch and use it to open up a room with a blue elevator. Percy
	can press a console next to this elevator to raise the characters to the final area in the level...

Room 3B -> In front of you is the purple door area. Muriel can use her flight to enter the room and press the white switch to spawn
	a crate. Bruno can carry this crate into the orange barrier area and use it as a platform to reach the purple button, 
	which will hold the purple doors open while stood on.

	Have Percy stand on the Orange button to disable the anti-magic barrier. Have Muriel stand on the purple button while
	Bruno carries the crate to the red button. Stand Bruno on the orange button and have Percy then Muriel move to the exit.
	Bruno can leave the purple door area and join the other chracters in the exit by hopping on the crate and jumping through 
	its window.

Room 4 -> Have Muriel stand on the red button. Have Bruno press the white button, which will spawn a crate on the green platform,
	and stand on the yellow platform. The yellow platform can be raised by having Percy press the yellow switch. This allows
	Bruno to reach the green button and lower the green platform, which in turn, allows Percy to grab the crate off the platform
	with his kinesis.

	Once you have the crate, you'll need to set the crate onto the blue button to hold the blue door to the exit open. First, 
	however, you'll need to get someone up to the blue button area to move the crate once it is up there. To accomplish 
	this, we'll lift Bruno up to the area. Have Bruno stand on the red button so that Muriel can raise Percy up using the yellow
	platform. Stand Percy on the purple button, which will allow Muriel to fly and lower the green platform. Swap to Bruno
	and use the crate to hop up onto the green platform. Raise the green platform back up and have Bruno jump up to the
	blue button area.

	Now you just have to get the crate up there to Bruno. Move Muriel out of the green button area and have Percy go back 
	down and grab the crate. Use Muriel to raise Percy and the Crate back up the yellow platform and have Percy levitate the
	crate to the blue button area. Finally, have Bruno place the crate on the blue button and move everyone into the exit.

Room 5 -> Collect the ingredient next to the cauldron and activate the "ghost enchantment". All moving platforms and grey walls can 
	be bypassed while a character has the ghost enchantment.Give the enchantment to Percy by having him interact with
	the cauldron. Then have him walk on the other side of the gray wall and step on the gray button to summon a crate on the
	other side of a glass grey wall. Ghosted characters can still walk through walls while carrying a crate, so you should be
	able to grab the crate and carry it back on the other side of the gray wall. Set the crate on the red button and move the
	Techie onto the lowered red platform.

	Give each the of remaining two characters the ghost enchantment and move them to the red platform. Before moving the
	final character to the red platform, have them interact with the second cauldron on the other side of the grey wall to
	remove the enchantment from them (Otherwise, they'll go through the platform instead of being lifted!). Once all the
	characters are on the red platform, swap to Percy and levitate the crate from atop the red platform. This should move
	all characters to the exit area.

Room 6 -> Collect the ingredient in the center of the room and activate the ghost enchantment (but don't give it to anyone yet!).
	As either Percy or Bruno, walk past the blue anti-magic barrier and disable it by standing on the blue button. Then,
	give any character the ghost enchantment and step onto the purple button to toggle it. This will lower the anti-magic
	barrier blocking enchanted characters from reaching the yellow button. 

	Swap to any character other than Muriel and, after enchanting them, walk through the grey wall and onto the yellow
	button. This will open the way to the exit, but also toggle on an anti-magic barrier blocking the way the character came in
	from. There is a second exit not blocked by a wall, but it also has an anti-magic barrier, so the character will be unable to
	reach the exit unless they can somehow remove their enchantment! This can be done by having a character transfer the 
	enchantment to themselves by interacting with the cauldron. Once you have done this, move the character in the yellow 
	button room out via the second exit up the ramp. Then move them and every other character to the exit.
